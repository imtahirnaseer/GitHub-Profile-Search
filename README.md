# GitHub Profile Search

This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles by username. It fetches user data using the GitHub API and displays information such as the user's name, bio, number of followers, following, public repositories, and a list of their recent repositories.

## How It Works

### 1. HTML Structure
The `index.html` file defines:
- An input field for searching a GitHub username.
- A `<main>` element to display the fetched profile information.

```html
<form class="user-form" id="form">
  <input type="text" placeholder="Search a GitHub User" id="search" />
</form>
<main id="main"></main>
